# XML Tutorial for Network Engineers

As a network engineer or someone involved in network automation efforts, I need to be able
to use XML data from network devices, such as NETCONFG, RESTCONF, or NXAPI, so that I can
extract the information I need to complete my tasks.

# Resources
**XML and XPath**<br/>
Read W3Schools section on XPath starting here: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp

In particular for Xpath expressions you will need to understand node selection techniques.

Node Selections: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp
Using Axes: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_axes.asp

You will also want to use builtin functions:
XPath Functions - https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xsl_functions.asp

**Python LXML package**<br/>
Documentation: https://lxml.de/

The LXML package provides for a few extension libraries, for example regular expressions:
