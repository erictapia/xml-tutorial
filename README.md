# XML Tutorial for Network Engineers

As a network engineer or someone involved in network automation efforts, I need to be able
to use XML data from network devices, such as NETCONFG, RESTCONF, or NXAPI, so that I can
extract the information I need to complete my tasks.

This repo contains information and tutorials that will help to navigate XML data using
Python and the LXML library.

# Contribute XML examples
If you have specific questions that you would like answered, please share you XML data
files in the [xml-files](xml-files) directory and ask your question in the issues area.

**XML and XPath**<br/>
Read W3Schools section on XPath starting here: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp

In particular for Xpath expressions you will need to understand node selection techniques.
